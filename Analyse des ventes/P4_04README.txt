***

List of technologies used within the project:

* [Python ](https://www.python.org): Version 3.8

## Installation
***

**System requirements**

Operating systems: Navigator supports the same operating systems that the Anaconda Distribution supports. These include:

Windows 8 or newer, 32-bit or 64-bit.
macOS 10.13+, 64-bit.
Ubuntu 14+/Centos7+, 64-bit.
Python: Versions 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.. 

To use Navigator in online mode, you must be able to reach these sites, so you may need to add them to a whitelist in your network’s firewall settings.

https://repo.anaconda.com for repositories and installers
https://conda.anaconda.org for conda-forge and other channels on anaconda.org
google-public-dns-a.google.com (8.8.8.8:53) to check internet connectivity with Google Public DNS


**Windows**

From the Start menu, click the Anaconda Navigator desktop app.
Or from the Start menu, search for and open “Anaconda Prompt” and type the command anaconda-navigator.


**MacOS**

Open Launchpad, then click the Anaconda-Navigator icon.
Or open Launchpad and click the terminal icon. Then in terminal, type anaconda-navigator.

*Linux

Open a terminal window and type anaconda-navigator.


**Managing Environments**

Navigator uses conda to create separate environments containing files, packages, and their dependencies that will not interact with other environments.

Create a new environment name and install a package in it:

In Navigator, click the Environments tab, then click the Create button. The Create new environment dialog box appears.
In the Environment name field, type a descriptive name for your environment.
Click Create. Navigator creates the new environment and activates it

Now you have two environments, the default environment base (root), and your new Environment name.

Switch between them (activate and deactivate environments) by clicking the name of the environment you want to use.

Tip: The active environment is the one with the arrow next to its name.
Return to the other environment by clicking its name.

**Managing Python**

When you create a new environment, Navigator installs the same Python version you used when you downloaded and installed Anaconda. If you want to use a different version of Python, for example Python 3.5, simply create a new environment and specify the version of Python that you want in that environment.

Create a new environment name that contains Python 3.5:

In Navigator, click the Environments tab, then click the Create button.

The Create new environment dialog box appears.
In the Environment name field, type the descriptive name choose and select the version of Python you want to use from the Python Packages box (3.8, 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, or 2.7). Select a different version of Python 

than is in your other environments, base or the choose name.

Click the Create button.

Activate the version of Python you want to use by clicking the name of that environment.




** Managing packages**

In this section, you check which packages you have installed, check which are available, and look for this list package and install it.

pandas 
numpy 
numpy, math
matplotlib.pyplot
matplotlib.mlab 
matplotlib.dates 
%matplotlib inline
scipy.stats
scipy.stats import gaussian_kde
scipy.stats import bartlett
statsmodels.api
statsmodels.formula.api 
seaborn 
warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
datetime 
datetime import date 



To find a package you have already installed, click the name of the environment you want to search. The installed packages are displayed in the right pane.

You can change the selection of packages displayed in the right pane at any time by clicking the drop-down box above it and selecting Installed, Not Installed, Updatable, Selected, or All.

Check to see if a package you have not installed on the environment name you have created is available from the Anaconda repository (must be connected to the Internet). On the Environments tab, in the Search Packages box, type the name environment you have created, and from the Search Subset box select All or Not Installed.

To install the package into the current environment, check the checkbox next to the package name, then click the bottom Apply button.

The newly installed program is displayed in your list of installed programs.
